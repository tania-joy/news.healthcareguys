This is good input for you guys to get ideas about how the subject areas might matter to the federal government and other public sector agencies. </p><p>Many of these products can easily be created by us independently (using our own tools and solutions we already have in place) while others can be integrated by us for our customers as a service provider. When wondering "what might agencies need?" this document presents a very nice taxonomy. You guys should register directly for these reports.<br></p>',author:{name:"Shahid Shah",email:"shahid.shah@netspective.com"},expiryDate:null,actualUrl:null,terms:[{categoryId:"129",name:"Netspective Communications"},{categoryId:"430",name:"Strategy &amp; Planning"}]}},pathContext:{id:"YXNzaWdubWVudDozNDIy"}}}});
