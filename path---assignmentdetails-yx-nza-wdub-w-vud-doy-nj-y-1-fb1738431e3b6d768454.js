Supervised, UnSupervised &amp; Reinforcement.&nbsp; If we take the example of supervised learning, we solve problems/predict where we know input &amp; label (Target) ahead. In the case of classification problem, we use different algorithms Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Decision Forests.And we have linear regression, logistic regression.&nbsp; The neural network is another candidate (example Gradient Descent).</p><p>&nbsp;Being said, along with choosing which programming language &amp; platform we choose, it is equally important to know which algorithm works perfectly for our problem.</p><p>The answer to the question "What machine learning algorithm should I use?" is always "It depends." It depends on the size, quality, and nature of the data. It depends on what you want to do with the answer. It depends on how the math of the algorithm was translated into instructions for the computer you are using. And it depends on how much time you have. Even the most experienced data scientists can\'t tell which algorithm will perform best before trying them.</p><p><br></p>',author:{name:"Mathew NJ",email:"mathew.nj@citrusinformatics.com"},expiryDate:null,actualUrl:"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/algorithm-choice",terms:[{categoryId:"374",name:"Citrus Training"},{categoryId:"129",name:"Netspective Communications"}]}},pathContext:{id:"YXNzaWdubWVudDoyNjY1"}}}});
